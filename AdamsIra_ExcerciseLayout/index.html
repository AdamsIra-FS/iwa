          <h1>Star Trek: First Contact Overview</h1>
          <p>
            <strong>Star Trek: First Contact</strong> is a 1996 American science
            fiction film directed by Jonathan Frakes in his feature film debut.
            It is the eighth movie of the Star Trek franchise, and the second
            starring the cast of the television series Star Trek: The Next
            Generation. In the film, the crew of the starship USS Enterprise-E
            travel back in time from the 24th century to the 21st century to
            stop the cybernetic Borg from conquering Earth by changing the past.
          </p>
          <p>
            After the release of Star Trek Generations in 1994, Paramount
            Pictures tasked writers Brannon Braga and Ronald D. Moore with
            developing the next film in the series. Braga and Moore wanted to
            feature the Borg in the plot, while producer Rick Berman wanted a
            story involving time travel. The writers combined the two ideas;
            they initially set the film in Renaissance Italy, but changed the
            time period that the Borg corrupted to the mid-21st century, after
            fearing the Renaissance idea would feel kitschy. After two
            better-known directors turned down the job, cast member Jonathan
            Frakes was chosen to direct to make sure the task fell to someone
            who understood Star Trek.
          </p>
          <p>
            The film's script required the creation of new starship designs,
            including a new USS Enterprise. Production designer Herman Zimmerman
            and illustrator John Eaves collaborated to make a sleeker ship than
            its predecessor. Principal photography began with weeks of location
            shooting in Arizona and California, before production moved to new
            sets for the ship-based scenes. The Borg were redesigned to appear
            as though they were converted into machine beings from the
            inside-out; the new makeup sessions took four times as long as their
            appearances on the television series. Effects company Industrial
            Light & Magic rushed to complete the film's special effects in less
            than five months. Traditional optical effects techniques were
            supplemented with computer-generated imagery. Jerry Goldsmith
            composed the film’s score.
          </p>
          <p>
            Star Trek: First Contact was released on November 22, 1996, and was
            the highest-grossing film on its opening weekend. It grossed a
            worldwide total of $146 million. Critical reception was mostly
            positive; critics including Roger Ebert considered it to be one of
            the best Star Trek films. The Borg and the special effects were
            lauded, while characterization was less evenly received. Scholarly
            analysis of the film has focused on Captain Jean-Luc Picard's
            parallels to Herman Melville's Ahab and the nature of the Borg.
            First Contact was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Makeup,
            and won three Saturn Awards. It was followed by Star Trek:
            Insurrection in 1998.

          <h2 id="plot">Plot</h2>
          <p>
            In the 24th century, Captain Jean-Luc Picard awakens from a
            nightmare in which he relives his assimilation by the cybernetic
            Borg six years earlier. He is contacted by Starfleet, who inform him
            of a new Borg threat against Earth. Picard's orders are for his
            ship, USS Enterprise, to patrol the Neutral Zone in case of Romulan
            aggression; Starfleet is worried that Picard is too emotionally
            involved with the Borg to join the fight.
          </p>
          <p>
            Learning the fleet is losing the battle, the Enterprise crew
            disobeys orders and heads for Earth, where a single Borg Cube ship
            holds its own against a group of Starfleet vessels. Enterprise
            arrives in time to assist the crew of USS Defiant and its commander,
            the Klingon Worf. Picard takes control of the fleet and directs the
            surviving ships to concentrate their firepower on a seemingly
            unimportant point on the Borg ship. The Cube launches a smaller
            spherical ship towards Earth before being destroyed. Enterprise
            pursues the sphere into a temporal vortex. As the sphere disappears,
            Enterprise discovers Earth has been altered—it is now populated by
            Borg. Realizing the Borg have used time travel to change the past,
            Enterprise follows the sphere through the vortex.
          </p>
          <p>
            Enterprise arrives hundreds of years in the past on April 4, 2063,
            the day before the historic warp drive flight that leads to
            humanity's first encounter with alien life. The crew realizes the
            Borg are trying to prevent first contact and assimilate humanity
            while the planet is recovering from a devastating war. After
            destroying the Borg sphere, an away team transports down to Zefram
            Cochrane's warp ship, Phoenix, in Bozeman, Montana. Picard has
            Cochrane's assistant Lily Sloane sent back to Enterprise for medical
            attention. The captain returns to the ship and leaves Commander
            William T. Riker on Earth to make sure Phoenix's flight proceeds as
            planned. While in the future Cochrane is seen as a hero, in reality
            he built the Phoenix for financial gain and is reluctant to be the
            historic figure the crew describes.
          </p>
          <p>
            A group of Borg invade Enterprise's lower decks, assimilating some
            of the crew and modifying the ship. Picard and a team attempt to
            reach engineering to disable the Borg with a corrosive gas, but are
            forced back; the android Data is captured in the melee. A frightened
            Lily corners Picard with a weapon, but he gains her trust. The two
            escape the Borg-infested area of the ship by creating a diversion in
            the holodeck. Picard, Worf, and the ship's navigator, Lieutenant
            Hawk, travel outside the ship in space suits to stop the Borg from
            using the navigational deflector to call for reinforcements, but
            Hawk is assimilated in the process. As the Borg assimilate more
            decks, Worf suggests destroying the ship, but Picard angrily calls
            him a coward. Lily confronts the captain and makes him realize he is
            acting irrationally because of his own past with the Borg. Picard
            apologizes to Worf and orders the activation of the ship's
            self-destruct and evacuation of the crew to escape pods, while he
            stays behind to rescue Data.
          </p>
          <p>
            As Cochrane, Riker, and engineer Geordi La Forge prepare to activate
            the warp drive on Phoenix, Picard discovers that the Borg Queen has
            grafted human skin onto Data, giving him the sensation of touch he
            has long desired so that she can obtain the android's encryption
            codes to the Enterprise computer. Although Picard offers himself to
            the Borg in exchange for Data's freedom, Data refuses to leave,
            deactivates the self-destruct, and fires torpedoes at Phoenix. At
            the last moment the torpedoes miss, and the Queen realizes Data
            deceived her. The android ruptures a coolant tank, and the corrosive
            vapor eats away the biological components of the Borg as well as
            Data's new skin.
          </p>
          <p>
            With the Borg threat neutralized, Cochrane completes his warp
            flight. Later that night, the crew watches from a distance as an
            alien Vulcan ship, attracted by the Phoenix warp test, lands on
            Earth. Cochrane greets the aliens. Having ensured the correction of
            the timeline, Picard bids Lily farewell and the Enterprise crew slip
            away and return to the 24th century.

          <h2 id="cast">Cast</h2>
          <p>
            First Contact is the first film in the Star Trek film series in
            which none of the main characters from The Original Series appear.
            Rather, the main cast of Star Trek: The Next Generation play the
            following characters:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Patrick Stewart</strong> as Jean-Luc Picard, the captain
              of the USS Enterprise-E who is haunted by his time as a member of
              the Borg. Stewart was one of the few cast members who had an
              important role in developing the script, offering suggestions and
              comments. Picard's character was changed from the "angst-ridden
              character [viewers have] seen before", to an action hero type.
              Stewart noted that Picard was more physically active in the film
              compared to his usual depiction.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Jonathan Frakes</strong> as William T. Riker, the ship's
              first officer who leads the away team on Earth. Frakes said he did
              not have much difficulty directing and acting at the same time,
              having done so on the television series.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Brent Spiner</strong> as Data, an android and the ship's
              second officer, whose ambition is to become more human. Rumors
              before the film's release suggested that since Data's skin had
              been largely removed at the end of the story, it would allow
              another actor to assume the role.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>LeVar Burton</strong> as Geordi La Forge, the ship's chief
              engineer who helps repair the Phoenix. La Forge was blind, and had
              been depicted wearing a special VISOR to see. Burton had lobbied
              for the VISOR to be discarded, since it hid his eyes and
              restricted the actor's ability to convey thoughts and emotions.
              The VISOR was replaced in First Contact by ocular implants, which
              were shown to be artificial but otherwise unexplained.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Michael Dorn</strong> as Worf, the commander of the USS
              Defiant and Picard's former chief of security.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Gates McFadden</strong> as Beverly Crusher, the ship's
              doctor. In an interview before the film's premiere, McFadden said
              she considered women finally on par with the men in Star Trek:
              "We've come a long way since Majel Barrett was stuck in the sick
              bay as Nurse Chapel in the [1960s] and made to dye her hair
              blond."
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Marina Sirtis</strong> as Deanna Troi, counselor aboard
              the Enterprise. Sirtis missed working on the television show, and
              was acutely aware that expectations and stakes for First Contact
              were high; "we were scared that people thought we couldn't cut it
              without the original cast", she said.

          <h3>Development</h3>
          <p>
            In December 1992, Paramount Pictures executives approached Star
            Trek: The Next Generation producer Rick Berman to develop two films
            featuring the cast of the television series. Berman decided to
            develop two screenplays simultaneously, and prioritize the most
            promising one for the first film. The effort of writers Brannon
            Braga and Ronald D. Moore was chosen and developed into Star Trek
            Generations. The other, by Maurice Hurley, was set aside to use in a
            possible second movie. Two months after the release of Generations,
            Paramount decided to produce the second feature for a winter holiday
            1996 release. Paramount wanted Braga and Moore, who had written the
            Generations script and a number of Next Generation episodes, to pen
            the screenplay. Berman told Braga and Moore that he wanted them to
            think about doing a story involving time travel. Braga and Moore,
            meanwhile, wanted to use the Borg. "Right on the spot, we said maybe
            we can do both, the Borg and time travel," Moore recalled. The Borg
            had not been seen in full force since the fourth-season episode of
            The Next Generation, "The Best of Both Worlds" and had never been
            heavily featured in the series due to budget constraints and the
            fear that they would lose their scare factor. "The Borg were really
            liked by the fans, and we liked them," Moore said. "They were
            fearsome. They were unstoppable. Perfect foils for a feature story.
          </p>
          <h3>Design</h3>
          <p>
            First Contact was the first Star Trek film to make significant use
            of computer-generated starship models, though physical miniatures
            were still used for the most important vessels. With the
            Enterprise-D destroyed during the events of Generations, the task of
            creating a new starship fell to veteran Star Trek production
            designer Herman Zimmerman. The script's only guide on the appearance
            of the vessel was the line "the new Enterprise sleekly comes out of
            the nebula". Working with illustrator John Eaves, the designers
            conceived the new Sovereign-class Enterprise-E as "leaner, sleeker,
            and mean enough to answer any Borg threat you can imagine". Braga
            and Moore intended it to be more muscular and militaryesque. Eaves
            looked at the structure of previous Enterprise iterations, and
            designed a more streamlined, capable war vessel than the
            Enterprise-D, reducing the neck area of the ship and lengthening the
            nacelles. Eaves produced 30 to 40 sketches before he found a final
            design he liked and began making minor changes. Working from
            blueprints created by Paramount's Rick Sternbach, the model shop at
            effects house Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) fabricated a 10.5-foot
            (3.2 m) miniature over a five-month period. Hull patterns were
            carved out of wood, then cast and assembled over an aluminum
            armature. The model's panels were painted in an alternating matte
            and gloss scheme to add texture. The crew had multiple difficulties
            in prepping the miniature for filming; while the model shop
            originally wanted to save time by casting windows using a clear
            fiberglass, the material came out tacky. ILM instead cut the windows
            using a laser. Slides of the sets were added behind the window
            frames to make the interior seem more dimensional when the camera
            tracked past the ship.
          </p>
          <p>
            In previous films, Starfleet's range of capital ships had been
            predominantly represented by the Constitution-class Enterprise and
            just five other ship classes: the Miranda class from Star Trek II:
            The Wrath of Khan, the Excelsior and the Oberth class from Star Trek
            III: The Search for Spock, and the Galaxy and Nebula classes from
            The Next Generation. ILM supervisor John Knoll insisted that First
            Contact's space battle prove the breadth of Starfleet's ship
            configurations. "Starfleet would probably throw everything it could
            at the Borg, including ships we've never seen before," he reasoned.
            "And since we figured a lot of the background action in the space
            battle would need to be done with computer-generated ships that
            needed to be built from scratch anyway, I realized there was no
            reason not to do some new designs." Alex Jaeger was appointed visual
            effects art director to the film and assigned the task of creating
            four new starships. Paramount wanted ships that would look different
            from a distance, so the director devised multiple hull profiles.
            Knoll and Jaeger had decided that the ships had to obey certain Star
            Trek ship precedents, with a saucer-like primary hull and elongated
            warp nacelles in pairs. The Akira class featured the traditional
            saucer section and nacelles combined with a catamaran-style double
            hull; the Norway class was based on the USS Voyager; the Saber class
            was a smaller ship with nacelles trailing off the tips of its saucer
            section; and the Steamrunner class featured twin nacelles trailing
            off the saucer and connected by an engineering section in the rear.
            Each design was modeled as a three-dimensional digital wire-frame
            model for use in the film.
          </p>
          <p>
            The film also required a number of smaller non-Starfleet designs.
            The warp ship Phoenix was conceived as fitting inside an old nuclear
            missile, meaning that the ship's nacelles had to fold into a space
            of less than 10 feet (3 m). Eaves made sure to emphasize the
            mechanical aspect of the ship, to suggest it was a highly
            experimental and untested technology. The Phoenix's cockpit labels
            came from McDonnell-Douglas space shuttle manuals. Eaves considered
            the Vulcan ship a "fun" vessel to design. Only two major Vulcan
            ships had been previously seen in Star Trek, including a courier
            vessel from The Motion Picture. Since the two-engine ship format had
            been seen many times, the artists decided to step away from the
            traditional ship layout, creating a more artistic than functional
            design. The ship incorporated elements of a starfish and a crab.
            Because of budget constraints, the full ship was realized as a
            computer-generated design. Only a boomerang-shaped landing foot was
            fabricated for the actors to interact with.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Enterprise interior sets were mostly new designs. The bridge was
            designed to be comfortable-looking, with warm colors. Among the new
            additions was a larger holographic viewscreen that would operate
            only when activated, leaving a plain wall when disabled. New
            flatscreen computer monitors were used for displays, using less
            space and giving the bridge a cleaner look. The new monitors also
            allowed for video playback that could simulate interaction with the
            actors. The designers created a larger and less-spartan ready room,
            retaining elements from the television series; Zimmerman added a set
            of golden three-dimensional Enterprise models to a glass case in the
            corner. The observation lounge was similar to the design in the
            Enterprise-D; the set itself was re-used from the television show,
            the only such set not to be struck following the filming of
            Generations, though it was expanded and underwent a color change.
            Engineering was simulated with a large, three-story set, corridors,
            a lobby, and the largest warp core in the franchise to date. For its
            Borg-corrupted state, the engineering section was outfitted with
            Borg drone alcoves, conduits and Data's "assimilation table" where
            he is interrogated by the Queen. To save money, the sickbay set from
            Voyager was redressed to serve as the sickbay of Enterprise, while
            the USS Defiant scenes were filmed on Deep Space Nine's standing
            set. Some set designs took inspiration from the Alien film series,
            Star Wars and 2001: A Space Odyssey.

            The spacewalk scene on the Enterprise exterior was one of the most
            challenging sets to envision and construct for the film. The
            production had to design a space suit that looked practical rather
            than exaggerated. Fans were built into the helmets so that the
            actors would not get overheated, and neon lights built into the
            front so that the occupant's faces could be seen. When the actors
            first put the helmets on, the fully enclosed design made it hard to
            breathe; after a minute of wearing the suit Stewart became ill, and
            shooting was discontinued. The set for the ship's outer hull and
            deflector dish were built on gimbals at Paramount's largest sound
            stage, surrounded by bluescreen and rigged with wires for the zero
            gravity sequences. The stage was not large enough to accommodate a
            full-sized replica of the Enterprise dish, so Zimmerman had to scale
            down the plans by 15 percent.

          <h3>Costumes and Makeup</h3>
          <p>
            The Starfleet uniforms were redesigned for the film by the Star Trek
            costumer Bob Blackman to give a more militaristic feel, with grey
            padded shoulders, black torso/sleeves/leggings and colored
            undershirts/stripe cuffs. Since Blackman was also handling the
            costumes for the television series, non-Starfleet design clothes
            were delegated to Deborah Everton, a newcomer to Star Trek who was
            responsible for more than 800 costumes during production. Everton
            was tasked with updating the Borg's costumes to something new, but
            reminiscent of the television series. The bulky suits were made
            sleeker and outfitted with fiber optic lights. The time-travel
            aspect of the story also required period costumes for the mid 21st
            century and the 1940s "Dixon Hill" nightclub holodeck recreation.
            Everton enjoyed designing Woodard's costumes because the character
            went through many changes during the course of the film, switching
            from a utilitarian vest and pants in many shots to a glamorous dress
            during the holodeck scene.
          </p>
          <p>
            Everton and makeup designers Michael Westmore, Scott Wheeler, and
            Jake Garber wanted to upgrade the pasty white look the Borg had
            retained since The Next Generation's second season, born out of a
            need for budget-conscious television design. "I wanted it to look
            like they were [assimilated or "Borgified"] from the inside out
            rather than the outside in," Everton said. Each Borg had a slightly
            different design, and Westmore designed a new one each day to make
            it appear that there was an army of Borg; in reality, between eight
            and twelve actors filled all the roles as the costumes and makeup
            were so expensive to produce. Background Borg were simulated by
            half-finished mannequins. Westmore reasoned that since the Borg had
            traveled the galaxy, they would have assimilated other races besides
            humans. In the television series, much of the Borg's faces had been
            covered by helmets, but for First Contact the makeup artist removed
            the head coverings and designed assimilated versions of familiar
            Star Trek aliens such as Klingons, Bolians, Romulans, Bajorans, and
            Cardassians. Each drone received an electronic eyepiece. The
            blinking lights in each eye were programmed by Westmore's son to
            repeat a production member's name in Morse code.
          </p>
          <p>
            The makeup time for the Borg expanded from the single hour needed
            for television to five hours, in addition to the 30 minutes
            necessary to get into costume and 90 minutes to remove the makeup at
            the end of the day. While Westmore estimated that a fully staffed
            production would have around 50 makeup artists, First Contact had to
            make do with fewer than ten people involved in preparation, and at
            most 20 artists a day. Despite the long hours, Westmore's teams
            began to be more creative with the prosthetics even as they
            decreased their preparation times. "They were using two tubes, and
            then they were using three tubes, and then they were sticking tubes
            in the ears and up the nose," Westmore explained. "And we were using
            a very gooey caramel coloring, maybe using a little bit of it, but
            by the time we got to the end of the movie we had the stuff dripping
            down the side of [the Borg's] faces—it looked like they were leaking
            oil! So, at the very end [of the film], they're more ferocious."
          </p>
          <p>
            The Borg Queen was a challenge because she had to be unique among
            Borg but still retain human qualities; Westmore was conscious of
            avoiding comparisons to films like Alien.The final appearance
            involved pale gray skin and an elongated, oval head, with coils of
            wire rather than hair. Krige recalled the first day she had her
            makeup applied: "I saw everyone cringing. I thought, great; they
            made this, and they've scared themselves!" Frakes noted that the
            Queen ended up being alluring in a disturbing way, despite her evil
            behavior and appearance. Zimmerman, Everton and Westmore combined
            their efforts to design and create the Borgified sections of the
            Enterprise to build tension and to make the audience feel that
            "[they are being fed] the Borg".
          </p>
          <h3>Filming</h3>
          <p>
            Principal photography was more leisurely than on The Next Generation
            as only four instead of eight pages of script were filmed each day.
            Frakes hired a cinematographer new to the Star Trek franchise,
            Matthew F. Leonetti, whose work on films such as Poltergeist and
            Strange Days he admired. Being unfamiliar with the Star Trek canon,
            Leonetti prepared for the assignment by studying the previous four
            films in the franchise, each of which had used a different
            cinematographer (Donald Peterman on The Voyage Home, Andrew Laszlo
            on The Final Frontier, Hiro Narita on The Undiscovered Country, and
            John Alonzo on Generations). He also spent several days observing
            filming on the sets of Voyager and Deep Space Nine.
          </p>
          <p>
            Leonetti devised multiple lighting methods for the Enterprise
            interiors for ship standard operations, "Red alert" status, and
            emergency power. He reasoned that since the ship was being taken
            over by a foreign entity, it required more dramatic lighting and
            framing. While much of the footage was shot at 50–70 mm focal
            lengths using anamorphic lenses, 14 mm spherical lenses were used
            for Borg's-eye-view shots. Leonetti preferred shooting with long
            lenses to provide a more claustrophobic feel, but made sure the
            length did not flatten the image. Handheld cameras were used for
            battle sequences so that viewers were brought into the action and
            the camera could follow the movements of the actors. The Borg scenes
            were received positively by test-screening audiences, so once the
            rest of the film had been completed, additional scenes of the
            Enterprise crew being assimilated were added with leftover budget to
            add action.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since so many new sets were needed, filming began with location
            photography. Four days were spent in the Titan Missile Museum, south
            of Tucson, Arizona. The disarmed nuclear missile was fitted with a
            fiberglass capsule shell to stand in for the Phoenix's booster and
            command module. The missile silo provided a large set that would
            have been prohibitively expensive to build from scratch, but the
            cramped environment created difficulties. Each camera move was
            planned in advance to work around areas where the lighting would be
            added, and electricians and grips donned rock-climbing harnesses to
            move down the shaft and attach the lights. To give greater dimension
            to the rocket and lend the missile a futuristic appearance, Leonetti
            chose to offset the missile's metallic surface with complementary
            colors. Using different-colored gels made the rocket appear longer
            than it actually was; to complete the effect, shots from the
            Phoenix's nose downwards and from the engines up were filmed with a
            30 mm lens to lengthen the missile.
          </p>
          <p>
            From Arizona the crew moved to the Angeles National Forest in
            California for two weeks of nighttime filming. Zimmerman created a
            village of fourteen huts to stand in for Montana; the cast enjoyed
            the scenes as a chance to escape their uniforms and wear "normal"
            clothes. The last location shoot was at an art deco restaurant in
            Los Angeles' Union Station, which stood in for the Dixon Hill
            holonovel; Frakes wanted a sharp contrast with the dark, mechanical
            Borg scenes. While the cinematographer wanted to shoot the scene in
            black and white, Paramount executives deemed the test footage "too
            experimental" and the idea was dropped. The site made using
            high-wattage lights impractical, so Leonetti opted to use dimmer
            master lights near the ceiling and took advantage of a large window
            to shine diffused lights through. To give the scene a
            black-and-white feel, Leonetti made sure to use light without any
            coloration. "I like creating separation with lighting as opposed to
            using color," he explained. "You can't always rely on color because
            the actor might start to melt into the background." By separating
            the backlights, Leonetti made sure that the principal actors stood
            out of the backdrop. The shoot used a ten-piece orchestra, 15
            stuntmen, and 120 extras to fill the seats. Among the nightclub
            patrons were Braga, Moore, and the film's stunt coordinator, Ronnie
            Rondell.
          </p>
          <p>
            After location shooting was completed, shooting on the new
            Engineering set began May 3. The set lasted less than a day in its
            pristine condition before it was "Borgified". Filming then proceeded
            to the bridge. During normal operation scenes, Leonetti chose to
            cast crosslighting on the principals; this required the ceiling of
            the set to be removed and lighting grids to be situated around the
            sides. These lights were then directed towards the actors' faces at
            90-degree angles. The set was lined with window paneling backed by
            red lights, which would blink intermittently during red-alert
            status. These lights were supplemented by what Leonetti called
            "interactive light"; these were off-stage, red-gelled lights that
            cast flashing rims on the bridge set and heads of the crew. For the
            Borg intrusion, the lighting originated solely from instrument
            panels and red-alert displays. The fill light on these scenes was
            reduced so that the cast would pass through dark spots on the bridge
            and interiors out of the limited range of these sources. Small 30-
            and 50-watt lights were used to throw extremely localized shafts of
            light onto the sets.
          </p>
          <p>
            Next came the action sequences and the battle for the Enterprise, a
            phase the filmmakers dubbed "Borg Hell". Frakes directed the Borg
            scenes similar to a horror film, creating as much suspense as
            possible. To balance these elements he added more comedic elements
            to the Earth scenes, intended to momentarily relieve the audience of
            tension before building it up again. Leonetti reconfigured the
            lighting to reflect the takeover of the ship interiors. "When the
            ship gets Borgified, everything is changed into more of a
            squared-off, robotic look with sharp edges but rounded images," he
            explained. To give the corridor walls more shape, Leonetti lit them
            from underneath. Since the halls were so small and the ceilings
            would be visible in many of the shots, special attention was paid to
            hiding the light fixtures.

          <h3>Effects</h3>
          <p>
            The majority of First Contact's effects were handled by Industrial
            Light & Magic under the supervision of John Knoll; more than a
            quarter of the film's budget went to effects. Smaller effects
            sequences, such as phaser fire, computer graphics, and transporter
            effects, were delegated to a team led by visual-effects supervisor
            David Takemura. Accustomed to directing episodes for the television
            series, Frakes was frequently reminded by effects artist Terry
            Frazee to "think big, blow everything up". Most of the effects
            sequences were planned using low-resolution computer-generated
            animatics. These rough animated storyboards established length,
            action and composition, allowing the producers and director to
            ascertain how the sequences would play out before they were shot.
          </p>
          <p>
            First Contact was the last film to feature a physical model of the
            Enterprise. For the ship's dramatic introduction, the effects team
            combined motion control shots of the Enterprise model with a
            computer-generated background. Sequence supervisor Dennis Turner,
            who had created Generations' energy ribbon and specialized in
            creating natural phenomena, was charged with creating the star
            cluster, modeled after the Eagle Nebula. The nebular columns and
            solid areas were modeled with basic wireframe geometry, with surface
            shaders applied to make the edges of the nebula glow. A particle
            render that ILM had devised for the earlier tornado film Twister was
            used to create a turbulent look within the nebula. Once the shots of
            the Enterprise had been captured, Turner inserted the ship into the
            computer-generated background and altered its position until the
            images matched up.
